                    <h3>What is Angular?</h3>
                    This topic can help you understand Angular: what Angular is, what advantages it provides, and what
                    you might expect as you start to build your applications.
                    Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
                        <li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including
                            routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more</li>
                        <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="section-paragraph">
                        To understand the capabilities of the Angular framework, you need to learn about the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Components</li>
                        <li>Templates</li>
                        <li>Directives</li>
                        <li>Dependency injection</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                <section class="main-section" id="developer_guides">
                    <header class="section-header">Developer guides</header>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">
                        As an application framework, Angular includes a collection of well-integrated libraries that
                        cover a wide variety of features.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">
                        The Angular libraries include routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">
                        This topic lists the various developer guides for you to learn more about these Angular features
                        and to help you determine the correct use of each in your application.

                    <h3>Security</h3>
                    This topic describes Angular's built-in protections against common web-application vulnerabilities
                    and attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks. It doesn't cover application-level security, such
                    as authentication and authorization.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    The web is used by a wide variety of people, including those who have visual or motor impairments. A
                    variety of assistive technologies are available that make it much easier for these groups to
                    interact with web-based software applications. In addition, designing an application to be more
                    accessible generally improves the user experience for all users.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-paragraph">
                    <h3>Keeping Up-to-Date</h3>
                    Just like Web and the entire web ecosystem, Angular is continuously improving. Angular balances
                    continuous improvement with a strong focus on stability and making updates straightforward. Keeping
                    your Angular application up-to-date enables you to take advantage of leading-edge new features, as
                    well as optimizations and bug fixes.
